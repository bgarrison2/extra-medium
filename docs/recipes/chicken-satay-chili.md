##Ingredients
* Spicy peanut sauce to taste

* 2 lbs chicken thighs

* Onion, diced

* 3 cloves garlic, diced or pressed

* 2 red bell peppers, diced

* 1 can of fire roasted diced tomatoes

* 2-3 cups of chicken bone broth

* Rub, preferably with a lemongrass and turmeric component

##Steps
1. Prepare the peanut sauce and set aside. Most of the seasoning in this recipe comes from this sauce.

2. Grill 2 lbs of chicken thighs. I seasoned mine with a store-bought lemongrass rub, but S+P or a BBQ rub would be great.

3. In a dutch oven, sautee two chopped red bell peppers, one chopped onion, season with S+P and add garlic in the last 30 seconds to avoid burning it.

4. Add a can of diced, fire-roasted tomoatoes, chopped up chicken thighs, and enough peanut sauce and chicken broth to have the consistency and spice that you like.

5. Simmer until you are ready to eat.
